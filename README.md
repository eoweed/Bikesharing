# Citi Bike Analysis

### Overview:
##### This project analyzes New York City bike sharing data from Citi Bike to determine if it is worth opening a bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. The data is from August 2019 and includes information on customer user type, birth year and gender, bike ID, start and end locations, and trip time and duration.
##### The goal is to answer questions such as how long do users checkout bikes, when are the most popular times to use the bikes, and who are the most frequent users per gender and user type?

<!-- ##### A link to the Tableau Story can be found [here](link/to/tableau) -->

### Results:
##### Included in the analysis are 7 visualizations:
1. Length of bike checkout times for all users
2. Frequency of trips per weekday and hour for all users
3. Length of bike checkout times by gender
4. Frequency of trips per weekday and hour by gender
5. Frequency of trips per weekday by gender and user type
6. Breakdown of customers by gender
7. Breakdown of customers by user type

##### By looking at the length of bike checkout times and the frequency of trips per weekday and hour, it seems that the most common trip length is about 5 minutes long, and the most popular times to use the bikes are weekdays from 7am-10am and 5pm-8pm. Weekends also have moderate use throughout most of the day between 10am-8pm.

##### The above information has also been further broken down by gender and shows that males most often have a trip length of about 5 minutes, females have a trip length of 6 minutes, and unknown gender at about 11 minutes. The chart showing trips per weekday and hour by gender also show the most popular times to use the bikes are similar across all genders, and that males are the most common users.

##### The graph displaying the frequency of trips by weekday for each gender and user type shows that the most common users are males that subscribe to the bike-sharing service. This can also be easily visualized in the pie charts that breakdown the number of bike trips per gender and per user type.

### Summary:
##### In conclusion, most bike trips in New York City last about 5 minutes and very few trips last longer than 30 minutes. The most popular checkout times occur around rush hours on the weekdays, but throughout the day on weekends, and males who subscribe to the bike sharing service are the most frequent users.
##### If a bike sharing business were to open in Des Moines, Iowa, similar results would be expected for popular checkout times, and most frequent users. However, it may be helpful to further analyze this data and create visualizations to determine if age plays a role in bike use and determine the number of bike stations, number of available bikes, and distance between start and end stations. 
##### Lastly, obtaining additional information could help determine if Des Moines is as bikeable as New York. Does Des Moines have bike paths? Is it relatively flat and easy to bike? Will the weather determine how frequently the bikes are used? And what is the city population compared to New York to determine how many bikes we will need?
